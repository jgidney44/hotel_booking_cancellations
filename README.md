# hotel_booking_cancellations
Project completed near the start of my data science internship, predicting how likely someone is to cancel their hotel booking

The dataset is large set of bookings at a portuguese hotel. I have cleaned the data, visualised and analyised the data (lots of clear and interesting plots including some time series forecasting using Facebook Prophet). I have used two models, first XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting, a form of decision tree model) and secondly an ANN (artificial neural network) and then assessed these models using various metrics.
